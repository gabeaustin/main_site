			<h1>About Me</h1>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2>
				One of the best songs to describe me would probably be <em>Express Yourself</em> by Labrinth.<br>
				<em>I say the same thing twice I'm awkward when I speak</em><br>
				That's me all day!
			</h2>

			<h3>
				I'm a quirky, introvert, but I have a fun side. I enjoy trying new things. With my personality, you wouldn't guess how adventurous I can be. I really want to go skydiving.

				I say the same thing twice I'm awkward when I speak <br>
				Ain't got the perfect smile don't turn heads on my street <br>
				Trying to be a superstar like everybody else <br>
				But being myself is something I do well <br>
				Whatever you do, do it good <br>
				Whatever you do, do, do, do, lord, lord, lord <br>
				Do it good, alright <br>
				Express yourself, express yourself, whoa do it <br>
				See it's not what you look like, when you doing what you doing <br>
				Express yourself, whoa do it <br>
				I don't make the papers I am far from JLS (JLS) <br>
				Ain't got the x factor I'm not what they expect (Listen) <br>
				But it won't be long before my turn is next, to express <br>
				Now without you expect <br>
				See whatever I do, I do it good <br>
				Do, do, do, do, do, do, do <br>
				So whatever you do, do, do, do, lord, lord, lord <br>
				Do it good, <br>
				Express yourself, express yourself, whoa do it <br>
				See it's not what you look like, when you doing what you doing <br>
				Express yourself, whoa do it <br>
				Loose myself in time, tearing too high <br>
				Shooting what you got, whoa <br>
				It's nothing wrong with perfect and perfect <br>
				Now it's your time to shine <br>
				Express yourself, click your fingers now <br>
				Express yourself, come on, <br>
				See it's not what you look like, when you doing what you doing <br>
				Express yourself, whoa do it <br>
				See it's not what you look like, when you doing what you doing <br>
				Express yourself, come on now, yeah, come on, now, <br>
				Come on now, yeah, come on, now, <br>
				Come on now, yeah, come on, now, <br>
				Come on now, yeah, come on, now <br>
